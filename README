= Rich's Organizer for Wine (ROW)

ROW is mobile app that was born from the sheer desire for an intuitive and elegant way to organize and categorize one's wine collection.  That way, I can easily pick which bottle I should or should not drink depending on its maturitythe mood I'm in that day.  Also, ROW provides a market price for each wine (via Wine-Search.com).  So should the posh wines I've purchased have enough demand, I can sell it at a fair/profitable price.

There are probably much better written and looking apps out there in this category.  But building this app helps me connect with my developer / creative side, and keep up my coding and prototyping disiplines.

ROW is a FileMaker based mobile app that requires FileMaker Go to run this app.  FileMaker Go can be downloaded for free at http://www.filemaker.com/products/filemaker-go/


= Requirement
* Android or iPhone
* FileMaker Go
* Some wine you have not drink yet


= Future Plan
* Add temperature reading.  Plan to use Arduino as thermometer's base platform.
