= Rich's Organizer for Wine (ROW)

ROW is an mobile device based application that was born from the sheer desire for an intuitive and elegant way to categorize one's wine collection.  Furthermore, I want to have a way to dynamically track the wine's current value (should the wine be that posh and know that we can auction the wine off at a fair starting price).

ROW is a FileMaker based mobile app that requires FileMaker Go to run this app.  FileMaker Go can be downloaded for free at http://www.filemaker.com/products/filemaker-go/

= Requirement
* Android or iPhone
* FileMaker Go

= Future Plan
* Add connectivity to temperture sensor.  Plan to use Arduino as thermometer's base platform
